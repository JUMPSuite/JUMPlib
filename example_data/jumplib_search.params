####### --- DYNAMIC INTENSTIY TOLERANCE CONCEPT ---#####
#
##Add the Dynamic Intensity correction or static tolerance correction for ms2 matching
##If you choose Dynamic Intensity correction here than you will need the file generated from JUMP mass calibration program
#
##If you choose static, you will have to put value in tol =; else keep the file for Dynamic intensity and tolerance generated from mass calibration program
tolerance_type = Static
#
dyn_tol_file = /Users/spoudel1/Desktop/JUMP_specLib/Program/finalProgram/massCalForSecondSearch/MasCalSecondSearch/SD_Intensity_LookUpTable.txt
#
##tolerance for ms2 matching = fragment ion tolerance, If Dynamic is selected tolerance will be in SD for example tol = 3 for 3SD; if static is selected the tolerance will be in ppm for example tol = 10 for 10 ppm
